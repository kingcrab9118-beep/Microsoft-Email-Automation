        <p>I hope you're doing well. This will be my final email regarding the opportunity I mentioned for {{ company }}.</p>
        
        <p>I completely understand that timing isn't always right, and priorities can shift quickly in your role as {{ role }}. No worries at all if this isn't something you're focused on right now.</p>
        
        <div class="final-offer">
            <p><strong>Before I close the loop, I wanted to offer one final resource:</strong></p>
            <p>I've created a simple [resource/tool/guide] specifically for companies like {{ company }} that are [relevant situation/challenge]. It's completely free and might be useful even if we never work together.</p>
            <p>Would you like me to send it over? It takes 2 minutes to read and has some actionable insights you could implement right away.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>If not, that's perfectly fine too. I'll stop reaching out and won't add you to any mailing lists or follow-up sequences.</p>
        
        <div class="respectful-close">
            <p>I genuinely appreciate your time and wish you and the {{ company }} team continued success. If circumstances change in the future and you think there might be a fit, you have my contact information.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Take care, {{ first_name }}.</p>
